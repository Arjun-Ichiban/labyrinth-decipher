Randomized Prim's algorithm

function createMaze(rows, cols)

    grid[][] := where 1->path 0-> wall
    grid := 1   \\ Start with a grid full of walls. 

    unvistedCells :- A set containing unvisited wall
    Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the adjacent walls at a distance 2 of the cell to the unvisitedCells list.

    while unvisitedCells is not empty:

        randamWall  \\pick a random wall from the unvistedCells list
        neigbourPath    \\pick a random neighbour of the randamWall which is a path 

        connect(randomWall, neigbourPath)   \\make the random wall and the cell in between the randomWall and neigbourPath as a path
        update the unvistedCells    \\add the new adjacent walls of the randomWall(which is now a path) to the unvistedCells list

        remove randomWall from unvistedCells
